Mini deep learning library

Coded in pure numpy (for learning purposes and fun)

It can calculate gradient of functions (more of them soon)

Next steps:
  
  1. Implement efficient convolution layer (using numpy vectorization)
  2. Teach autoencoder on images (maybe VAE, bVAE)
  3. Code some reinforcement learning algorithms: PPO, DQN
  4. Teach neural network to play games looking at game pixels!
  5. Compare RL algorithm with genetic ones (I am really interested in NEAT and want to implement it myself)
